# Challenge5_Matplotlib_ZR

For Challenge 5, to screen potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer, a complete data set from a mice study was provided to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens. Key findings of the analysis are:

•	According to a bar chart plotted for the total number of rows for Mouse ID/Timepoints for each drug regimen throughout the study, Ramicane and Capomulin appear to be more counts than Infubinol and Ceftamin out of the four treatments of interest.

•	A pie chart showing the distribution of female and male mice in the study indicated that the number of males and females used in the study was even.

•	A line plot for a single mouse treated with Capomulin for tumor volume vs time indicated that the tumor size continued to increase until the day 20 and start to reduce in size with some fluctuation.

•	A scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen showed a positive correlation.
